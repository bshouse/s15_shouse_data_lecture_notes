 ##Credit where due
 Big Data: Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems
 Makeing Sendse of NoSQL: A guide for managers and the rest of use
 
 ##Problem: Traditional DBs
 Imagine: Web Analytics App to track page views by customerId
   Many customers/views=timeouts
   So....You batch updates..All good for now
   More requests in....Flooding ensues
   Still a DB bottleneck
     Relational Solutions
       Vertical Scaling
         Upgrade Hardware
         Add Cache Server
       SHARD
         Multi-Instance
         Multi-Hardware
         Partition Data
     Fault Tolerance still needs to be considered (HARD)
     Human Error Considerations (Lack of Fault Tolerance)
     Operational Complexity
     Hidden Glue Code (Maintenance)
     Application Layer Complexity (Maintenance)
     
##NoSQL to the Rescue
Distributed by nature (SHARD/Replication managed by default)
Horizontally scalable
  Just Add Servers
Avoids Mutable Data (Versioned Data)
Fault Tolerant

##Types of NoSQL DB
* Key-Value
* Graphs
* Columnar (Column Store different)
* Document

###Key-Value
Hash table style
Benefit: Siimply

###Graph Store
Graph Relationships
Benefit: Structural Query Languages

###Columnar Stores (Column Family Stores)
Benefit: Scales well, fast writes
Basic Data Model:
  Hashtables all the way
  Uneven multi-demensional array
  Distributed HashTable
  
###Document Stores
Insert Documents (Bags for key-value pairs)
Data is heavily indexed
